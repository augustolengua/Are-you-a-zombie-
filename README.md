# Are you ready for the zombie apocalypse?

This code was written in R.

Our team decides to identify supplies that protect people and coordinate supply distribution. A few brave data collectors volunteer to check on 200 randomly selected adults who were alive before the zombies. We have recent data for the 200 on age and sex, how many are in their household, and their rural, suburban, or urban location. Our heroic volunteers visit each home and record zombie status and preparedness. Now it's our job to figure out which supplies are associated with safety!
